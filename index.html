      <h2>Welcome to My Website</h2>
      <p>Hi. I'm Rob Mayo, and I made this website myself. I'm proud of that, since making websites isn't something I usually do. By day, I'm an ELA teacher in New York City, at a school in the Bronx. Computers have always been a hobby of mine, and I usually spend most of my free time playing video games or watching videos online. I figured learning to make websites might be something I'd be good at, and a fun way to spend my time outside of school. This Portfolio Page is the result of that decision.
